# VBA-challenge
##VBA project for Datavis class (Week 2)

## Given Folder
Has two worksheets provided by course for use as data and practice. The Alphabet testing spreadsheet was a small sample of stock information. The Multiple year spreadsheet is a much larger data set to show the importance of using VBA.

## My_work Folder
Has the given spreadsheets (.xlsx spreadsheets). The xlsm spreadsheets have macros enabled and these are the spreadsheets that I modified with my VBA code. My VBA script can be found in the "Code_Submission.txt" file. This I acheived the base amount required and challenge #2 as stated in the Readme, the challenges weren't required, but I gave them my best effore. The "Partial_Code_Submission.txt" file has my script achieveing challenge #1 from the readme in the given folder.

The reason that I couldn't combine the challenges had to do something with types not matching even though they did and I spend most of my time trying to debug this issue and could only find one similar issue (see stackoverflow link below). This however did not provide a solution as it seemed that VBA just didn't like changing to percent format at times.
